Below is my final answer.png, my final image produced with OpenCV as specified by the coding challenge description:

## Libraries used
I only used two libraries in my solution: **cv2** (OpenCV), and **NumPy**. 
I used cv2 to allow me to perform the image processing/computer vision tasks necessary for this project - finding the cones, creating the mask, and drawing the lines.
I used NumPy as a way to create arrays to hold to HSV values that I needed to perform color thresholding. I chose to use these as opposed to python Lists as NumPy arrays are faster and more compact than Python lists.

## Methodolgy

## What I tried and why I think it did not work
Some of the challenges I ran into were as follows:
